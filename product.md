#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Our product is a schedule optimizer that offers suggestions on what priority to place on various assignments and tests. The problem we are trying to address is that students have a hard time managing their time and don’t know how to prioritize efficiently especially when under stress. We are planning to build a mobile app allowing students to allocate their time to meet the academic goals that they provide.

For example, a student is in the middle of midterm season and has 3 midterms and 4 assignments with just 5 days to get ready for everything. It would be very difficult to complete all these tasks at a high level so the student needs to decide what to prioritize. Our app would calculate how much time to allocate to each task and present a few reasonable solutions. One recommended suggestion the app would say is: “Spend 5 hours studying for midterm2, Skip your 9:00am lecture since there’s no upcoming tasks for this class(Allocate time to catch up next week!), consider using 2 grace tokens on A2 since its only worth 5%.”

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...
Our target audience is post secondary students that need help with time management and have heavy workload.

PERSON 1(Sally):
- 3rd Year Engineering student taking 6 courses to get ahead.
- Hopes to maintain a 4.0 average
- Attends all lectures, does extra credit.

Sally is an ideal user as she has a heavy schedule and possibly needs to have less things on her plate.

PERSON 2(Jim):
- 1st Year student
- adjusting to university life, a bit overwhelmed
- hasn’t made a proper study habits yet.

Jim is also a highly possible user as he still needs to learn proper study habits.

   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

Currently students make their own schedules with calendar apps. Students do not have time to make their own schedules. Our app would be providing the schedules for them and optimize their time depending on their needs. It would also be able to manage non academic programs. Time would be saved through a dynamically updating schedule that fits the user’s needs. Users would have access to optimal schedules and goal setting while also being able to keep track of their academic progress.
