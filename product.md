#### Q1: What are you planning to build?


Our product is a schedule optimizer that offers suggestions on what priority to place on various assignments and tests. The optimizer would allow users to specify their own academic goals and output a schedule based on course material weights and estimated difficulty. For example, a student can choose to put less effort on an easier course to save time for more demanding courses. The app would have daily prompts to stay up to date with the user’s progress and dynamically update the schedule to accommodate unforeseen events. The problem we are trying to address is that students have a hard time managing their time and don’t know how to prioritize efficiently especially when under stress. Our app would attempt to solve this problem by taking as much information as possible about the users time and provide a dynamic plan of action. We are planning to build a mobile app allowing students to allocate their time to meet the academic goals that they provide. In addition, other features we are considering is to include extracurricular events and activities and integrate them with the user’s academic schedule.

For example, a student is in the middle of midterm season and has 3 midterms and 4 assignments with just 5 days to get ready for everything. It would be very difficult to complete all these tasks at a high level so the student needs to decide what to prioritize. Our app would calculate how much time to allocate to each task and present a few reasonable solutions. One recommended suggestion the app would say is: “Spend 5 hours studying for midterm2, Skip your 9:00am lecture since there’s no upcoming tasks for this class(Allocate time to catch up next week!), consider using 2 grace tokens on A2 since its only worth 5%.” The student can now choose which path to take. Additionally, the user can pick and choose between our provided solutions to customize their plans.



#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target audience are UofT students who have trouble sticking to a schedule and who have trouble focusing on their studies. This product will also be for students who have plenty of extracurriculars and have trouble balancing that with doing well in their classes. 


PERSON 1(Sally):
- 3rd Year Engineering student taking 6 courses to get ahead.
- Hopes to maintain a 4.0 average
- Attends all lectures, does extra credit.
- Is a key member to 3 school clubs
- Becomes anxious very easily when responsibilities pile up

Sally is an ideal user as she has a heavy schedule and possibly needs to have less things on her plate. This product would help her to not panic when she is swamped with work and will not only prepare her for the more hectic periods of her schedule but would also guide her in the best way to approach it.

PERSON 2(Jim):
- 1st Year student
- adjusting to university life, a bit overwhelmed
- hasn’t made a proper study habits yet.
- having trouble with chemistry
- really likes playing video games
- doesn't properly distribute his time to work on all of his courses

Jim is also a highly possible user as he still needs to learn proper study habits. Since Jim is a chronic procrastinator, this product would help him better plan out when he has time for his games and when it is time to buckle down. Jim is also an excellent user for this product's reminder system, as it will make sure Jim stays on track and focused when doing his school work. 


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Currently students make their own schedules with calendar apps. Students do not have time to make their own schedules or keep updating them throughout the semester. The task of having to maintain a schedule is stressful and time consuming. Our app would be providing the schedules for them and optimize their time depending on their needs. Also, our app would dynamically keep up with changes and make the necessary updates. It would also be able to manage non academic programs. Time would be saved through a dynamically updating schedule that fits the user’s needs. Unlike regular calendar apps, our app would ask for daily updates and provide feedback on your academic progress depending on your provided goals, in addition to providing regular deadline reminders. Users would have access to optimal schedules and goal setting while also being able to keep track of their academic progress.
