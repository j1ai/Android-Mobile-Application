#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Our product is a schedule optimizer that offers suggestions on what priority to place on various assignments and tests. The problem we are trying to address is that students have a hard time managing their time and don’t know how to prioritize efficiently especially when under stress. We are planning to build a mobile app allowing students to allocate their time to meet the academic goals that they provide.

For example, a student is in the middle of midterm season and has 3 midterms and 4 assignments with just 5 days to get ready for everything. It would be very difficult to complete all these tasks at a high level so the student needs to decide what to prioritize. Our app would calculate how much time to allocate to each task and present a few reasonable solutions. One recommended suggestion the app would say is: “Spend 5 hours studying for midterm2, Skip your 9:00am lecture since there’s no upcoming tasks for this class(Allocate time to catch up next week!), consider using 2 grace tokens on A2 since its only worth 5%.”

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target audience are UofT students who have trouble sticking to a schedule and who have trouble focusing on their studies. This product will also be for students who have plenty of extracurriculars and have trouble balancing that with doing well in their classes. 


PERSON 1(Sally):
- 3rd Year Engineering student taking 6 courses to get ahead.
- Hopes to maintain a 4.0 average
- Attends all lectures, does extra credit.
- Is a key member to 3 school clubs
- Becomes anxious very easily when responsibilities pile up

Sally is an ideal user as she has a heavy schedule and possibly needs to have less things on her plate. This product would help her to not panic when she is swamped with work and will not only prepare her for the more hectic periods of her schedule but would also guide her in the best way to approach it.

PERSON 2(Jim):
- 1st Year student
- adjusting to university life, a bit overwhelmed
- hasn’t made a proper study habits yet.
- having trouble with chemistry
- really likes playing video games
- doesn't properly distribute his time to work on all of his courses

Jim is also a highly possible user as he still needs to learn proper study habits. Since Jim is a chronic procrastinator, this product would help him better plan out when he has time for his games and when it is time to buckle down. Jim is also an excellent user for this product's reminder system, as it will make sure Jim stays on track and focused when doing his school work. 


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Currently students make their own schedules with calendar apps. Students do not have time to make their own schedules. Our app would be providing the schedules for them and optimize their time depending on their needs. It would also be able to manage non academic programs. Time would be saved through a dynamically updating schedule that fits the user’s needs. Users would have access to optimal schedules and goal setting while also being able to keep track of their academic progress.
