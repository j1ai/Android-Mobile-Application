# OptiPlan/Team 16

## Iteration 3

 * Start date: March 22, 2018
 * End date: March 29, 2018

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * 1) The team imposed solid deadlines on when members should be done their tasks, as opposed to the last deliverable where members finished their parts at their own pace.
 * This change should make it so that the parts of the app that need to be finished first are completed. Also, it makes connecting pages more streamlined because the parts which are going to be connected will be have relatively the same deadline date. Additionally, it allows for clear prioritization of tasks.
 
 
#### Roles & responsibilities

 * Gurkaran -- Front End Developer (Main Page) and Meeting Lead -- Responsible for implementing 'add' and 'delete' capabilities for the majors, courses, and assignments parts of the main menu. Also is responsible for fixing the 'modify' function for assignments. Other responsibilities include leading the team meetings and facilitating the other members towards clear goals.   
 *Alexander -- Lead Designer and Quality Control -- Responsible for connecting all the parts of the front end together, ensuring that the login page is fully operational with invalid login and repeated registration detection, and making sure that the app knows if a user is logged in. Also, add a dropdown menu that allows for easy navigation between registration pages
 * 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * 
#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be to-do lists, task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
