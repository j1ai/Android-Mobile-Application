# OptiPlan/Team 16

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 29, 2018
 * Where: BA2185, Tutorial

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Deciding to impose solid deadlines for tasks allowed for more efficient work and clear priorities. We were able to approximately know when to expect an aspect of our project to be ready so that we could plan and build on it quickly. For example, persisting the data of our app using Firebase was a major task and so we planned deadlines accordingly. Then using this, we were able to quickly develop more front end capabilities on top. This was an overall successful decision since we may not have met our final deadline if we were held back by a slow working pace.

* Assigning multiple people to major tasks such as front end developing and algorithm design allowed for an even distribution of workload. This was successful since all our tasks were completed on time.

* Taking notes during meetings allowed us to keep track of all ideas that were brought up and how they would be implemented.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * Our Github workflow could have been improved through better communication as there were cases where we accidently worked on outdated code.
 
 * We used a group chat on Facebook Messenger as a means to discuss the project outside of scheduled meetings. At times this became a disorganized form of communication as we had 7 people actively discussing different things and it was hard to keep track of ideas. 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* There are no planned changes as this is the final version of our app.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Persisting app data and allowing for database actions such as a user adding and removing their own courses.

 * Improving front end capabilities to allow for a standardized input through dropdowns and scrolling dates.

 * Designing an optimizing algoritm

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We were unable to implement the part of our algorithm that would have allowed us to output three different optimized schedules that have a low, medium, high 
 * We were unable to use an assesment ID to link all of the relations in our database together. This ended up not being a huge issue as we were able to find another attribute to use a central key
 
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Preparing for the final demo
