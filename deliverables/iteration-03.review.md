# OptiPlan/Team 16

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 29, 2018
 * Where: BA2185, Tutorial

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


* Deciding to impose solid deadlines for tasks allowed for more efficient work and clear priorities. We were able to approximately know when to expect an aspect of our project to be ready so that we could plan and build on it quickly. For example, persisting the data of our app using Firebase was a major task and so we planned deadlines accordingly. Then using this, we were able to quickly develop more front end capabilities on top. This was an overall successful decision since we may not have met our final deadline if we were held back by a slow working pace.

* Assigning multiple people to major tasks such as front end developing and algorithm design allowed for an even distribution of workload. This was successful since all our tasks were completed on time.

* Taking notes during meetings allowed us to keep track of all ideas that were brought up and how they would be implemented.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 *  
 
 * We used a group chat on Facebook Messenger as a means to discuss the project outside of scheduled meetings. At times this became a disorganized form of communication as we had 6 people actively discussing different things and it was hard to keep track of ideas. 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
