# Team 16


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 9, 2018
 * Where: Tutorial in BA2185

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * Drawing a storyboard displaying all the pages and how they interact with each other. This turned out to be a good decision because it helped format how the different pages would connect with each other. Also, it made it easier to delegate tasks to each member when the app was organized by pages.
 * Delegating each page to one member of the group and then assigning the connection of the individual pages to one person. This was a successful decision as it allowed for equal distribution of work among members. We assigned the task of connecting all the pages to the member with the least overall workload
 * Deciding to collaborate on the demo script while all of us were in one room. This decision was successful because it made writing the script more straightforward and minimized the risk of creative blocks with six people contributing to the script.
 
#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* Deciding to not include a database to store user information for each unique user. 
* Trying to complete too many features for one deliverable. We tried to do too much with designing both the front end and back end, and were not able to get to coding the back end of our app.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
