## Iteration 02

 * Start date: March 01, 2018
 * End date: March 09, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

* Gurkaran -- Front End Developer (Menu Page) -- Responsible for initializing project hierarchy, implement the drop down menu and implement the in-app navigation.
* Alexander -- Lead Designer -- Responsible for creating the login page for the app, storing user data, and encrypting passwords. In addition, oversee the overall development of the app.
* Michael -- Front End Developer (Home Page) -- Responsible for designing the home page, make it so that it displays the daily schedule of the user, and provide an integration of the drop down menu.
* James -- Front End Developer (Registration Page 1) -- Responsible for receiving user input and organizing users' subject POST. Adding in a drop down menu of official majors
* Justin -- Front End Developer (Registration Page 2) -- Responsible for making sure input regarding courses is available, and providing a drop down menu of official courses to choose from.
* Sujith -- Front End Developer (Registration Page 3) -- Responsible for gathering the syllabus information for each of the courses inputted previously by the user. Possibly work on displaying a table showing type of assessment, name , weight and due date. These types can be inputted through drop down menus with suggestions.
* Kyle -- Front End Developer (Add Task Page) -- Responsible for developing a page to handle additional non academic activities that the user would like to keep in their optimized schedule.

* All developers work on the back end as well as teams of 2 or 3 work on the three different optimization algorithims. 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.
  
 * App Layout Planning Meeting(In person Tutorial): Plan the page layout of our app, features to be implemented, and assign work.(March 1).
 * Coding session(Online): Three times a week(March 1 - March 9). These are dedicated coding sessions set aside to work together in addition to our own individual work periods.
 * Sync Meeting(In Person Tutorial): Debrief our progress and review what still needs to be done before the deadline. (March 8).
 * Review Meeting (Online): Review our final product for this iteration. (March 10).  

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   
   * To-do List: We will add all the required features, assign work, and prioritize them by difficutly.
   Tasks can also be assigned by team member strengths and knowledge on the topic as well as interest.
   At this point in our iteration, the tasks all have an even priority.
   * Storyboard: A layout of pages and the navigation of a typical user's usage session of the app.
   

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.

 * Our Github workflow will follew a similar workflow to the assignments.
 Everyone will fork their own copies to work on their own individual tasks. 
 Pull requests will be done from each team member's individual repos to the master repo. They will then be accepted and merged by majority and discussion.

 * We will follow a naming convention of our commit messages that describes what was changed and anything that needs to be done.
 
 * We chose these workflow policies because everyone is experienced with this method and it is reasonable for our 7 person group.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.
 
 * Our main goal is to fully complete the front end of the app as well as some back end. 
   This includes all the tasks listed under Roles and Responsibilities such as logging in, adding courses and viewing your schedule.
   We plan to have between 7-12 front end pages that were shown in our storyboard.
 * For the back end, we hope to get started on the optimizing algorithm that schedules user tasks. 


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
  
 * Paper prototype storyboard: This is the drawn design of user navigation through the app and page design of individual pages.
 * Screen shot storyboard: This is a more developed design storyboard showing screenshots of our coded app.
