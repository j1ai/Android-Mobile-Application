# project-team-16

## use the *strings.xml* located in *res/values* instead of hardcoding literals

### chernou1:

* added login activty and made it the launcher
* email and password are both "asdf"
* signing in brings us to the menu activity done by Chubbles6
* added option in menu activity to sign out and return to sign in page

### NOTE:

- no real authentication or user storage is implemented as of yet, also signing out doesn't actually "sign out", just goes back to the opening screen... gotta remove from cache later on or something
