# project-team-16

## use the *strings.xml* located in *res/values* instead of hardcoding literals

### chernou1:

* register now goes through course activity and update syllabus activity
* sign in goes straight to the menu activity

### NOTE:

- no real authentication or user storage is implemented as of yet, also signing out doesn't actually "sign out", just goes back to the opening screen... gotta remove from cache later on or something
